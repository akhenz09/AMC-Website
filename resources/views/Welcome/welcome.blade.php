My name is Donald, one of your podcasters. You will hear more from me as we move forward with our podclass.<br><br><br><span class="click">Click here to read more</span></p></button>
                <center><div id="About" class="collapse">
                    <p>The AMC Podclass is a brainchild of PLE REAP for all aspiring international medical graduates who wish to build a career as a medical practitioner in Australia.</p>


                    <p>The past 2 years had been quite challenging for the rest of the world due to the pandemic, but Australia is one of the very few developed economies that stood strong in spite of it. Today, Australia has reopened its borders to the rest of the world. Its a welcome news for everyone!</p>


                        <p>The AMC Podclass is the first of its kind digital platform for the Australian Medical Council CAT MCQ Exam, both locally and internationally. It was designed by our very own head coach, Doctor Janill, to best suit the working clinician by optimizing the most recent, effective, evidence-based study techniques available to date. These are spaced repetition and active recall.</p>


                            <p>Pretests allow every examinee to get a grasp of their knowledge and evaluate themselves as to where they stand in the status quo. Pretests work best for examinees who have not read the appropriate reading materials in advance.</p>

                                <p>Flashcards using Anki is a powerful memory tool. To date, only the AMC podclass optimizes this tool to its full potential.</p>

                                    <p>Let’s admit it, even if you are probably not aware of it, the average attention span especially in the digital platform is only 30-45 minutes based on studies. After this, very little information sips in, with so much time wasted. Nobody really learns much from hours of sitting in front of the class or the computer, this in spite of succesfully hurdling your respective board exams. As we always say, you passed not because of it, but in spite of it. This is why we think that a podcast approach is more useful. You only get a few minutes of the most important points to remember, but you are assured of the outcome’s quality. You also have the power to space them out according to your readiness. The podcasts features several accents as well, that will allow you to have a feel of the manner of communication in Australia. The first time you hear an Australian speak, you'll know what I mean. Furthermore, Australia isvery multicultural (IMGs, regugees, skilled workers) and you expect extreme diversity in cultural backgrounds including language and accents. If you have never been to Australia before, you will be surprised to experience all of it the first time.</p>


                                        <p>Understandably, there will always be the need to reinforce important points and high yield topics, and to provide coaching as well. This is the purpose of the live lecture. It is important that you don’t miss the live lecture because PLE REAP will not be providing a recording of this in order to protect its intellectual property.</p>


                                            <p>Repeated MCQs with actual and reformulated recalls make up the core of your AMC preparation. The podclass is well aware of this, and is precisely the reason why your pre-trial, post-trial, pretests, and lecture MCQs are all heavily based on the highest yielding and most recent recalls in the exam. You may actually notice that the questions in your exams are sometimes a bit off in grammar, syntax and semantics, and this is because we are trying to avoid as much as possible, modifying the recalls. We want to present them as they are, and guide you instead on deciphering which is good, and which is poor recall.</p>

                                                <p>The secret to the AMC exams is to answer as many questions as you can, of course correctly. Recently however, new out of this world questions have been added to the pool of MCQs.</p>


                                                    <p>It is important to underscore the fact that the AMC CAT MCQ is both expensive and not an easy exam. One has to really make a sacrifice, set aside an ample time to prepare, about 1-2 hours daily. For example, when you listen to the podcasts, make sure that it is the only thing that is keeping your attention. Do not play the podcasts while exercising, driving, or bathing. Most importantly, do not use it as a lullaby. As one of your podcasters, that is just hurtful.</p>


                                                        <p>Make sure also that you do your Anki daily as well. Anki’s settings on active recall is already impressive in itself. Do extra of this in your spare time.</p>


                                                            <p>No big dreams come easy. While most will succesfully hurdle the exam, some may not, in their first try. Its ok! Just keep pushing. Most of the IMGs working in Australia have done the process, either step 1 or 2, more than once. But their perseverance paid off.</p>

                                                                <p>Once again, on behalf of the PLE REAP Family, your coaches, Dr. Janill, Jinx, Kris, Timi, Febbie, and Ann: welcome to the AMC podclass! Cheers!</p>
